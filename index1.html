            <p>During my 10th grade, I had the opportunity to participate in a town-level chess competition organized by a local NGO in Proddatur. This event was open to all age groups and welcomed participants from all walks of life, regardless of gender. I competed alongside many talented players from my town, and I was proud to secure a position in the top 20. This experience not only challenged my strategic thinking but also fostered a deeper appreciation for the game of chess and the spirit of healthy competition.</p>
